I have created an index.html page in my sophwang27.github.io repository that my
tufts cs website redirects to. On that index page is a "picture of me," a link 
to my resume webpage, and a link to my bio page. 
I have a stylesheet for each of my three webpages. I worked most extensively on
my resume-style.css stylesheet.

I have spent approximately 4-5 hours on this assignment.
